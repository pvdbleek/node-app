# node-app

This is a starter ExpressJs project, you can run it as a standalone
app using `npm run server` in the root of the project.
The server will be listening to request on port `3000`,
so you can test the server in a browser accessing `http://localhost:3000` or via `cURL`.

Before running the command `npm run server` you need to run `npm install` to
install the dependencies
# Kubernetes

This project uses skaffold (https://skaffold.dev/) and buildpacks (https://buildpacks.io/)
to handle the creation of the image and deployment of the kubernetes resources.

Before doing the deployment make sure that you have skaffold and buildpacks on your env, to install them
follow the instructions in:

 - https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/
 - https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/

# Deploy App

To deploy the app, run the following command:

```
skaffold run -p local --port-forward
```

look for the command output, it should the tell you the port that is listening, so you can check the
app on `http://localhost:<port>`

To delete the app run

```
skaffold delete
```
